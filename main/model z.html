The Z1 featured unusual doors which, instead of opening outward or upward, dropped down into the door sills and had body panels which could easily be removed and replaced; the car could be driven with its body panels removed. Only 8,000 examples of the Z1 were produced. </p></td>

The Z3 underwent a facelift in 1999 with the introduction of a coupé bodystyle and featured revised styling, before the end of its production run in 2002. The coupé had controversial styling and was nicknamed as "clown shoe". It was manufactured and assembled in Spartanburg, South Carolina. </p></td>

The Z07 originally was designed as a styling exercise to celebrate the 507 roadster of the 1950s, but the overwhelming popularity of the concept spurred BMW's decision to produce a limited production model called the Z8. 5,703 cars were built, approximately half of which were exported to the United States. </p></td>
