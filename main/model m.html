Just like the regular models, three bodies are available: Sedan (E90), Coupé (E92), and Convertible (E93). For the first time, a BMW M3 has a V8 engine. The 4-liter assembly delivers 420 hp (309 kW) and turns up to 8,300 rpm – the highest-speed production engine ever built by BMW! With the optional M Driver’s Package, the car reaches a maximum speed of 280 km/h. </p></td>

This is only surpassed in 2018 by the BMW M5 Competition, which delivers 25 hp more, taking 625 hp (460 kW) to the streets. Limited to just one year of production, the BMW M5 CS (Competition Sport) accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.0 seconds with 635 hp (467 kW). Carbon parts reduce the weight of the extremely sporty sedan, which, on request, can be electronically controlled from 305 km/h.
